RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/sa_engine_ip_0/inst/u_core/u_sa_core/dpram_in/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/sa_engine_ip_0/inst/u_core/u_sa_core/dpram_in/ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: design_1_i/sa_engine_ip_0/inst/u_core/u_sa_core/dpram_in/ram_reg_0_i_7_n_0) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/sa_engine_ip_0/inst/u_core/u_sa_core/FSM_sequential_c_state_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
